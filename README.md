# Landing page for ChemAlive ConstruQt API
### Propulsion Academy Bootcamp Final Project

This project has been done as my final project for Full-Stack Development Bootcamp (Propulsion Academy, Zurich) together with Giorgos Xonikis (https://github.com/GiorgosXonikis). The goal of the project was to create a graphical user interface for chemical software (ConstruQt API). 
My jobs were server setup, configuring CI/CD process for the entire project, creating the design and working on the frontend with React/Redux. The project was originally developed on Gitlab.
